    This function should split a message into words, normalize them, and return

    you should convert everything to lowercase.

    Note for enterprising students:  There are myriad ways to split sentences for
    this algorithm.  For instance, you might want to exclude punctuation (unless
    it's organized in an email address format) or exclude numbers (unless they're
    organized in a zip code or phone number format).  Clearly this can become quite
    complex.  For our purposes, please split using the space character ONLY.  This
    is intended to balance your understanding with our ability to autograde the
    assignment.  Thanks and have fun with the rest of the assignment!
